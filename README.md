This repository contains a smart contract prototype demonstrating how a **Community Supported Agriculture (CSA)** program can be tokenized as a **Real World Asset (RWA)** on the blockchain.

This project has been successfully deployed to the **Avalanche Fuji Testnet** and includes a live DApp for interaction.

## Live Demo & Contract

You can interact with the live version of this project using the DApp prototypes below. Please make sure your wallet (e.g., MetaMask) is connected to the **Avalanche Fuji Testnet**.

### DApp Prototypes

*   **[➡️ Interact with the DApp (english version)](https://ecolab-web3.github.io/csa-rwa-solidity/index-en.html)**
*   **[➡️ Interaja com o DApp (versão em português)](https://ecolab-web3.github.io/csa-rwa-solidity/index-pt_br.html)**

### Admin Panel

*   **[➡️ Access the Admin Panel (english version, for contract owner only)](https://ecolab-web3.github.io/csa-rwa-solidity/admin-en.html)**
*   **[➡️ Acesse o Painel do Administrador (versão em português, somente para o proprietário do contrato)](https://ecolab-web3.github.io/csa-rwa-solidity/admin-pt_br.html)**

### Contract Details

*   **Network:** `Avalanche Fuji Testnet`
*   **Contract Address:** [`0x1c96D0701B1bd9c3CC24fAcca3A4d68ED8Bfb1AF`](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/address/0x1c96D0701B1bd9c3CC24fAcca3A4d68ED8Bfb1AF)
*   **Verification:** The source code is verified. You can read and interact with it directly on **[Snowtrace](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/address/0x1c96D0701B1bd9c3CC24fAcca3A4d68ED8Bfb1AF#code)**.

## Overview

The core idea is to transform a CSA "membership share" into an **ERC721Enumerable Non-Fungible Token (NFT)**. Each NFT represents a member's right to receive a weekly product box for a specific harvest season, turning this right into a liquid, transferable, and transparent digital asset.

### Key Concepts Implemented

*   **Season Management**: The contract owner (the farmer) can create new harvest seasons via a dedicated admin panel.
*   **Share Purchase (Minting)**: Community members can purchase a share through the DApp, which "mints" an NFT that proves their membership.
*   **Weekly Redemption**: The NFT owner can redeem their weekly product box.
*   **Automated Token ID Discovery**: The DApp automatically detects if a user is already a member and retrieves their Token ID.
*   **Security and Transparency**: The contract is `Ownable` and the code is publicly verified.

## Next Steps

This is a functional prototype. For a production-ready project, the next steps focus on upgradability and user experience.

### 1. Implement an Upgradable Contract using the Proxy Pattern

Smart contracts on the blockchain are immutable. To allow for future feature additions or bug fixes without forcing users to migrate to a new contract, the next logical step is to implement an upgradable contract.

*   **What it is:** The Proxy Pattern separates the contract's data (state) from its logic. Users interact with a stable "Proxy" contract address, which forwards all calls to a "Logic" contract. The contract owner can then deploy a new version of the Logic contract and update the Proxy to point to it.
*   **How to implement:** Using well-audited libraries like OpenZeppelin's Upgrades Contracts is the industry standard. This would involve restructuring the `CSA_RWA.sol` contract to be "upgrade-safe".
*   **Benefits:** This would enable future evolution, such as transforming the contract from a single-farmer model into a multi-farmer platform using an **"Access List Model"** (where the owner can register multiple farmers) or a **"Factory Model"** (where any farmer can deploy their own CSA instance from a central factory contract).

### 2. Enhance DApp and Admin Panel UI/UX

The current DApps are functional prototypes built with vanilla HTML/JS to prove the concept. A production version would require a significant design overhaul.

*   **User DApp (Interaction Pages):**
    *   Migrate to a modern frontend framework for better state management and component reusability.
    *   Implement a proper design system for a professional, responsive, and mobile-friendly interface.
    *   Improve user feedback with modals, loading spinners, and success/error notifications instead of a simple status box.
    *   Add features like a gallery to view the NFT "membership card", a history of redeemed boxes, and a progress bar for the current season.

*   **Admin Panel (Registration Page):**
    *   Transform the single-form page into a comprehensive **dashboard**.
    *   Display a list of all created seasons with their key statistics (price, capacity, number of members, start/end dates).
    *   Integrate UI components to call other `onlyOwner` functions from the contract, such as `closeSeasonSales` and `withdraw`, providing a complete management interface.
