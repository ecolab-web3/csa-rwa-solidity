## About The Project

This repository contains a smart contract prototype that tokenizes a **Community Supported Agriculture (CSA)** membership share as a **Real World Asset (RWA)** on the blockchain.

This project has been successfully migrated to a professional **Hardhat environment**, rigorously tested, deployed, and verified on the **Avalanche Fuji Testnet**.

## Live Demo & dApps

You can interact with the live version of this project using the dApp prototypes below. Please make sure your wallet (e.g., MetaMask) is connected to the **Avalanche Fuji Testnet**.

### dApp Prototypes

### Contract Details

*   **Network:** `Avalanche Fuji Testnet`
*   **Contract Address:** [`0x1c96D0701B1bd9c3CC24fAcca3A4d68ED8Bfb1AF`](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/address/0x1c96D0701B1bd9c3CC24fAcca3A4d68ED8Bfb1AF)
*   **Verification:** The source code is verified. You can read and interact with it directly on **[Snowtrace](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/address/0x1c96D0701B1bd9c3CC24fAcca3A4d68ED8Bfb1AF#code)**.

## Development Environment & Testing

This project was migrated from Remix IDE to a professional Hardhat environment to ensure quality and reproducibility.

*   **Framework:** Hardhat
*   **Solidity Version:** `0.8.20`
*   **Testing:** A comprehensive test suite was developed using `ethers.js` and `Chai`. The suite consists of **26 passing tests** covering all contract functions and logic paths.

### Test Coverage

The project achieved the following test coverage:

| File             | % Stmts | % Branch | % Funcs | % Lines |
|------------------|---------|----------|---------|---------|
| **CSA_RWA.sol**  | 96.67   | 89.29    | 100     | 100     |
| **All files**    | 96.67   | 89.29    | 100     | 100     |

**Note on Code Coverage:** The coverage tool correctly identifies a redundant `require` statement in the `buyMembership` function. A preceding line (`uint256 seasonId = seasons.length - 1;`) already prevents execution with an empty `seasons` array due to an arithmetic underflow, making the `require` check's failure path unreachable. Since the contract is already deployed and immutable, this code will not be altered in this version. The optimization is listed as a next step for future versions.

## Overview

The core idea is to transform a CSA "membership share" into an **ERC721Enumerable Non-Fungible Token (NFT)**. Each NFT represents a member's right to receive a weekly product box for a specific harvest season, turning this right into a liquid, transferable, and transparent digital asset.

### Key Concepts Implemented

*   **Season Management**: The contract owner can create new harvest seasons via a dedicated admin panel.
*   **Share Purchase (Minting)**: Community members can purchase a share through the dApp, which "mints" an NFT.
*   **Weekly Redemption**: The NFT owner can redeem their weekly product box.
*   **Automated Token ID Discovery**: The dApp automatically detects if a user is a member and retrieves their Token ID.
*   **Security and Transparency**: The contract is `Ownable` and the code is publicly verified.

## Next Steps

This is a functional prototype. For a production-ready project, the next steps focus on code optimization, upgradability, user experience, and security.

### 1. Contract Refinement (Code Optimization)

As identified during the test coverage analysis, the next version of the contract will remove the redundant `require` statement in the `buyMembership` function. This will make the code cleaner and slightly more gas-efficient, allowing the test suite to achieve 100% branch coverage.

### 2. Implement an Upgradable Contract using the Proxy Pattern

To allow for future feature additions or bug fixes without forcing users to migrate to a new contract, the next logical step is to implement an upgradable contract using OpenZeppelin's Upgrades Contracts. This would enable future evolution, such as transforming the contract into a multi-farmer platform.

### 3. Enhance dApp and Admin Panel UI/UX

The current dApps are functional prototypes. A production version would require enhancing them with a modern framework and adding features like an NFT gallery, redemption history, and a more comprehensive admin dashboard.

### 4. Undergo a Professional Security Audit

Before deploying to a mainnet and handling real value, a full audit by a reputable third-party security firm is essential to ensure the safety of the system.
